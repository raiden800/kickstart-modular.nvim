    After understanding a bit more about Lua, you can use `:help lua-guide` as a
    reference for how Neovim integrates Lua.
    - :help lua-guide
    - (or HTML version): https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html

    MOST IMPORTANTLY, we provide a keymap "<space>sh" to [s]earch the [h]elp documentation,
    which is very useful when you're not exactly sure of what you're looking for.

-- Set <space> as the leader key
-- See `:help mapleader`
--  NOTE: Must happen before plugins are loaded (otherwise wrong leader will be used)
vim.g.mapleader = ' '
vim.g.maplocalleader = ' '

-- Set to true if you have a Nerd Font installed and selected in the terminal
vim.g.have_nerd_font = true

-- [[ Setting options ]]
require 'options'

-- [[ Basic Keymaps ]]
require 'keymaps'

-- [[ Install `lazy.nvim` plugin manager ]]
require 'lazy-bootstrap'

-- [[ Configure and install plugins ]]
require 'lazy-plugins'

-- The line beneath this is called `modeline`. See `:help modeline`
